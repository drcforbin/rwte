# rwte

xcb terminal emulator, with lua, cairo, and pango

## Todo

* Shifted function/insert/del/end/etc keys, like what's done in urxvt

## Notes

Borrows code and ideas from all over
* most code has been derived from st and rxvt-unicode, but xterm and vte
  were involved too. This terminal has no real advantage over the others;
  it's a toy project.
* the excellent [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library is embedded
